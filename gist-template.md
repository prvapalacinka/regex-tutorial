## Regex Components
Because regex expressions are considered to be a literal, the pattern must be wrapped in slash characters (/). The subsections below explain various types of regex components and their use.
### Anchors
Anchors (^) identify a string that starts with the character(s) that succeeds it. The $ anchor identifies a string that ends with certain characters that precede it. 
Two possible anchor variations exist: 
- Exact string match anchors.
- Range of possible match anchors using bracket expressions.
